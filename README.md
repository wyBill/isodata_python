ISODATA is an unsupervised clustering algorithm based on K-means which is widely used in industry and used for a wide variety of unsupervised learning tasks

## Parameters

* k_init: the initial number of cluster
* cluster: the number of clusters
* n_min: the minimum number of points per cluster
* I_max: the number of iterations
* sigma_max: the maximum standard deviation of poins within a cluster
* L_min: the minimum distance between cluster centers
* P_max: the maximum number of clusters that can be merged per iteration
